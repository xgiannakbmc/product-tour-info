# Developer-first approach to Control-M

## Control-M CLI installation and activation
To program with Control-M, you need that API. The simplest way is to install and activate the `ctm` commmand line.
As a Developer, you can offload your needs for future execution of any pipeline by starting using Control-M in few minutes, saving hours of difficult and non-critical development. Start by following this documentation page or the first two minutes of the Automation API Getting Started video, up to the point where you can call the ctm command line.
